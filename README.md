### Plugin is licensed under the terms of GNU GPLv3
## Note about this branch:
This version is made for the TreasureIsland minecraft servers. Therefore it doesn't include all the features
but rather only what we use:
* Backup
* Networkwatcher
* Save
* Restart

If you want the full version for 1.14, try the [1.14.2-hotfix branch](https://github.com/sarhatabaot/AutoSaveWorld/tree/1.14.2-hotfix).

*This is a test version and it is not recommended to use it in production.
But if you want to try you can get test build there http://build.true-games.org/job/AutoSaveWorld/*
